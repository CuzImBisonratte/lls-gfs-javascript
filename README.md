# LLS-JS GFS
This repo contains worksheets I wrote for a GFS (Gleichwertige Feststellung von Sch√ºlerleistungen - engl. equivalent assessment of pupil performance).  
I had to teach the basics of Javascript to my classmates in 1h30m.  

The lesson was structured in a very self-learning-oriented way, therefore the excessive amount of worksheets and explanations on them.  

The presentation held at the start can be found in `./presentation/` in Apple Keynote Format (Because we have iPads supplied by the school) and in PDF Format for ease of access.  

## Generating the worksheets
To generate the worksheets, you need to use LaTeX.

A script to create a distribution folder containing all worksheets as PDF can be found under `./distribute.sh` and should only be run from the root directory of this repository.

## Archival
This repository is archived, because the files are not changing any more.  
Have fun :)
